# Markov Messages <img src="/images/MarkovMessages.png?raw=true" height="40" alt=""/>

Markov Messages is a macOS-only application that will generate random texts based on your iMessage history. It uses the local chat database stored on your Mac, and markov chains to produce texts in a similar vein to your own.

### Run Locally
- Run `npm install` to build the node_modules folder.
- To run locally, use `npm start`.
- To build for distribution, use `npm run dist`.  You will need to modify the bundle ID info to your own.
